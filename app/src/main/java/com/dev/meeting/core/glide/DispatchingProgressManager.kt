/**
 * You need a HashMap to store the progress of the URLs you want to display the ProgressBar.
 * You also need another HashMap to store the UI listeners.
 * This is the method to add the URL and its UI listener to the HashMap.
 * You call this at the beginning of the download.
 * When the download of a URL is completed or returns an error, call this to remove the URL from both HashMaps.
 * You need a UI thread handler to update the UI because the progress is notified in the background thread.
 * Not all the URLs must have a progress listener. You don't need to show ProgressBar for a photo thumbnail.
 * Yay! Download completed. Forget this URL.
 * Remember the granularityPercentage in UIonProgressListener interface?
 * This is where you decide whether to update the UI if downloaded content length is worthy; i.e., not smaller than the granularity.
 * Here is the simple explanation.
 * You get the currentProgress by dividing the current percent by the granularityPercentage value.
 * Get the lastProgress from the HashMap, and compare currentProgress and lastProgress to see
 * if there's any change; i.e., currentProgress is greater than lastProgress by the multiple of granularityPercentage.
 * If that's the case, notify UI listener.
